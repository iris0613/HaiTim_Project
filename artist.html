        Vivian Maier

        <p>
        Vivian Dorothy Maier (born 1926) was an American street photographer whose work was not discovered and recognized until her death. She worked for about forty years as a nanny. A person who fit the stereotypical European sensibilities of an independent liberated woman, accent and all, yet born in New York City.
She was obsessed with the practice of taking photographs — which she did for most of her life, and she was obsessed with details of daily life on the streets, from newspapers to men wearing hats. She created incredible black and white and color work through the 1950’s all the way through the late 1990′s.
She was quite conservative. Most of the photos she took were just one shot of a scene. Sometimes when she thought the scene was really interesting, she would work the scenes and shoot up to 8 shots.
She photographed people who were stationary—and also people who she found interesting as they walked by her.

He renowned for his humanistic photographs. “You just have to care about what’s around you and have a concern with humanity and the human comedy,” he says.

Erwitt didn’t make out to become a great or famous photographer. Rather, he saw it as an enjoyable activity and let his photography be an extension of himself. “I’m an amateur photographer, apart from being a professional one, and I think maybe my amateur pictures are the better ones.” He is naturally curious, quirky, and humorous and used his camera to capture that in the world around him.

René Burri  (born 1933) was a Swiss Magnum photographer. He was master of documentary and street photography and he helped change photojournalism.
René Burri was where history was in the making. His photographs have had a huge influence on our visual understanding of the major political and cultural events of the second half of the twentieth century.
He never waits for the perfect moment to take a photograph; instead he quickly captures what is happening in front of the camera, which comes to include a distinctive picture.
A little luck and an extensive knowledge of art allowed Burri access to some of the most prestigious and important artists of his time, a rarefied list that includes Le Corbusier, Niemeyer, Giacometti, and Picasso, all of whose portraits he took repeatedly over the years.

Alfred Eisenstaedt (born 1898) was one of the luminaries of  German-born American photographer. He is best known for his candid black-and-white shots of celebrities, politicians, and captivating street shots. He was among those Europeans who pioneered the use of the 35-millimeter camera in photojournalism to get closer to his subjects and create more candid pictures.
Eisenstaedt was a master at finding the details that tell the big story. His style was unaffected and naturalistic; he let his subjects speak for themselves.
Eisenstaedt perfected certain techniques for capturing the spontaneous moment that has given us some of our most enduring photographic images. Also, he was a favorite among editors, not only for his quick eye but also for his ability in making good photographs of any situation or event. He became one of only four original staffers on Life magazine, winning numerous awards for his memorable images. Referred to as one of the founding fathers of photojournalism, he completed around 2500 photo-essays and ninety cover photographs for the magazine.

Nikos Economopoulos (born 1953) is a Greek photographer known for his photography of the Balkans and of Greece in particular. He works as a member of Magnum since 1990.
Thanks to his sense of composition and space, his subjects do not seem out of place, even in a barren and seemingly endless landscapes. His pictures are powerful and full of warmth, but never cute. The poverty of the people in these rural areas, in which he predominantly takes his photographs, remains visible.
“Photography for me is not premeditated. It’s pure instinct. I don’t like preparing for it but rather react to whatever I see and experience. I don’t like going somewhere with a pre-constructed assumption but rather going with just a few basic tools and bare pieces of information that I patch together in order to be able to experience things as freely and openly as I can. In this way, every new place is a wonderland. I do not even feel I am telling a story. As a photographer, you don’t answer the question that the frame poses. You create another question. The viewer has to wonder. And you are there, partaking in or even creating that wonder,”
He got extremely close to a subject in the foreground, and focused on subjects in the background without infringing on their privacy.

His works carry a strong sense of composition, form, and geometry but they also carry an emotional impact. His photos are raw, gritty, and show both the hope and melancholy of life.

Richard Sandler (born 1946) is a New York based documentary filmmaker, street photographer, photojournalist, photography curator, and saxophonist. He is thoughtful, erudite, and harbors a great passion for street photography.
Capturing some of the most iconic street photography of this bustling city in flux with his Leica, he documented generations of New Yorkers caught in the whirlwind of change that almost 25 years brought upon the city.
His work is collected by museums and individuals. Sandler’s New York of the late 70s and 80s is a cyclone of faces, furs, and filth. It’s a visceral cross-section of fabulous wealth and terrible misfortune, often found in the same frame.
